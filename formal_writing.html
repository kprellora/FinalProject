            <h1>Formal Writing</h1>
            <p>When learning how to write formally, it is important to know what good and bad habits are involved. This section looks more in-depth at some of the aspects in formal writing that you should and shouldn’t be doing.</p>

            <h2>Making your writing sound formal</h2>
            <p>It is usually the case that in formal writing you avoid the use of personal pronouns.  These include <em>I, me, we, us and you</em>.
               However there are instances in certain disciplines where your lecturer will invite you to use the first person.
               In reflective journal writing for example, using the first person is appropriate.</p>

            <h3>Where to avoid using personal pronouns</h3>
            <p><strong>When you are reporting what you did, a passive voice is used to make sure that the language sounds impersonal.</strong></p>

            <h3>Giving an opinion</h3>
            <p>You are often asked to present a point of view in your writing, but it is important that you do this in an appropriate way.</p>
            <p>The words in the table below help to grade the strength of your opinion. That is, they fill in the space between ‘yes’ or ‘absolutely’ or ‘no’ ‘not at all’. They are words which cover the ‘shades of grey’.</p>

            <h2>What to avoid in formal writing</h2>
            <p>When writing an essay, it is important to construct a reasoned argument supported by evidence and is not cluttered with words that distract the reader,
               shift the meaning, or lessen the quality of the argument. The following section goes over how to avoid doing this.</p>
         </section>
         <section id="cliches">
            <h3>Cliches</h3>
            <p>A cliché is an expression that has been overused.</p>
            <p><strong>Example</strong></p>
            <div class="example highlight">
               <ul>
                  <li>We cannot build a new school <strong>at this point in time.</strong></li>
                  <li>Who would have thought that slavery could exist in <strong>this day and age?</strong></li>
                  <li>The Prime Minister believed that <strong>at the end of the day</strong> her policies would be vindicated.</li>
               </ul>
            </div>
         </section>
         <section id="fspeech">
            <h3>Figures of speech</h3>
            <p>A figure of speech is a word or phrase that has a separate meaning to its literal definition. Figures of speech are closely related to clichés. They are primarily broken into two categories, similes and metaphors.</p>
            <div class="example highlight">
               <ul>
                  <li>The cleaners were advised <strong>to lift their game</strong> or else.</li>
                  <li>Management has been <strong>on a steep learning curve.</strong></li>
                  <li>It would be like looking for a <strong>needle in a haystack.</strong></li>
               </ul>
            </div>
         </section>
         <section id="simile">
            <h4>Similes</h4>
            <p>A simile compares a person, action or object with something else - for example, <strong>'fly like an eagle', 'solid as a rock', 'as happy as Larry', 'pleased as Punch'</strong>, and so on.</p>
            <p>Well-chosen metaphors and similes can give your writing immense expressive power. Once a metaphor or simile has become a cliché, it no longer provides a vivid image for the reader. Consequently, instead of impressing your readers with your writing style, you leave them with the impression that you have nothing of substance to say.</p>
         </section>
         <section id="metaphor">
            <h4>Metaphors</h4>
            <p>A metaphor is a way of describing an object or action that isn’t literally true, but helps explain or strengthen an idea/argument, such as <strong>'a glaring error', 'the heart of the matter', 'pillar of the community', 'wave of terrorism'</strong>.</p>
         </section>
         <section id="informal">
            <h3>Informal language</h3>
            <p>Colloquialisms are words or phrases that belong in conversational contexts:</p>
            <div class="example indented">
               <p>Everybody was wandering around like stunned mullets. (Dazed and confused) <br>
                  We'll all be pushing up daisies soon enough. (Dead)</p>
            </div>
            <p>In everyday speech or conversation we often contract words so that what we say does not sound too pompous.
               E.g. 'can not' (e.g. can't), 'have not' (e.g. haven't), 'is not' (isn't), 'would have' (would've), 'should have' (e.g. should've) and so on.
               However, in academic writing, colloquial forms should be avoided.</p>
            <p>Some colloquialisms, such as slang expressions or phrases might demean or exclude other language users and must also be avoided. See inclusive language.</p>
         </section>
         <section id="padding">
            <h3>Padding</h3>
            <p>Padding consists of all the extra words added to writing that do not add anything to the meaning or content of the text. This includes:</p>
            <ul>
               <li>Redundant phrases such as 'It is interesting/worthy/important to note that ...’ 'For what it's worth ...’.</li>
               <li>Irrelevant material which has no bearing on your topic.</li>
               <li>'Dead' words includes words which repeat other words e.g. dead corpse, combined together.</li>
               <li>Adverbs add quantity but little to the meaning. Adverbs such as: really, rather, quite, totally and so on, may not enhance your expression. For example: really obscure, rather tedious.</li>
            </ul>
         </section>
         <section id="complex">
            <h3>Complex writing</h3>
            <p>Sometimes writers think that by using big, unfamiliar words or complicated sentence structures that this makes their writing sound sophisticated or more important. But it usually just means that no one understands it. For example:</p>
            <div class="example indented">
               <p><em>This author concludes that, after due and full consideration, some writers exhibit discursive practices that produce undecipherable sentences, the intelligibility of which beggar even the most sophisticated ratiocinative beings.</em></p>
            </div>
            <p>The sentence could be rewritten in a number of ways:</p>
            <p><strong>Very simply</strong></p>
            <div class="example highlight">
               <p>Some people write so badly that no one understands it.</p>
            </div>
            <p><strong>More Complex</strong></p>
            <div class="example highlight">
               <p>Some people write in a way that makes it difficult for even quite educated people to understand them.</p>
            </div>
         </section>
         <section id="texting">
            <h3>Texting language</h3>
            <p>Texting language is the collective term used for the shorthand way that people talk to each other using text messages, email, instant messaging and other forms of written contact.
               Abbreviating words is common in text language as the examples below show.</p>
            <div class="example">
               <ul>
                  <li>asap - As soon as possible</li>
                  <li>atm - At the moment</li>
                  <li>b4 - Before</li>
                  <li>brb - Be right back</li>
                  <li>btw - By the way</li>
               </ul>
            </div>
            
            <p>These example and others are used in informal texting exchanges. It is important to remember that text language is <strong>not acceptable </strong>in formal writing such as essays, exams, reports etcetera.</p>
