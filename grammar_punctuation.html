         <h2>Problems in sentence construction</h2>
         <p>In this section, common problems relating toconstructing sentences have been identified so that students can become aware of these and avoid them in their writing.</p>
      </section>

      <section id="sstructure">
         <h3>Sentence Structure</h3>
         <p>Sentences can be short and concise, or longer and more complex. However, it is important to vary the length of your sentences so that your writing doesn't sound too abrupt (with the overuse of short sentences), or too densely packed with ideas (with the overuse of long sentences).</p>
         <p>One of the most common problems in writing is students writing sentence fragments rather than complete sentences.</p>
         <h4>What is a sentence?</h4>
         <p>A complete sentence (which is also called an independent clause) must always contain a subject and a verb. For example:</p>
         <div class="example highlight">
            <p><em>The bushfires devastated many of the areas in the Adelaide Hills</em></p>
         </div>
         <p>This first sentence contains a subject (The bushfires) and a verb (devastated) and then more information in given about what the bushfires devastated.</p>
         <p>You may sometimes see sentences without a subject but these are usually instructions. For example</p>
         <div class="example highlight">
            <p><em>Use the exit stairs in case of fire.</em></p>
         </div>
         <p>The subject (you or anybody reading this notice) is inferred from the situation but the verb is still there.</p>
         <h4>What is a sentence fragment?</h4>
         <p>A sentence fragment (which may also be a dependent clause) is an incomplete sentence because it is missing either the subject or the verb or both. For example:</p>
         <div class="example highlight">
            <p><em>Because of the northerly winds</em></p>
         </div>
         <p>Or a longer version:</p>
         <div class="example highlight">
            <p><em>Because of the northerly winds, years of drought and tinder-box bushland, along with an ill-prepared and under-equipped country fire service</em></p>
         </div>
         <p>The sentence fragment can be made into a complete sentence:</p>
         <div class="example highlight">
            <p><em>Because of the northerly winds, <strong>the fire spread quickly through the bushland.</strong></em></p>
         </div>
         <div class="example highlight">
            <p>The fire spread quickly through the bushland because of the northerly winds, years of drought and tinder-box bushland, along with an ill-prepared and under-equipped country fire service.</p>
         </div>
         <p>Here are some more examples of independent clauses:</p>
         <div class="example">
           <ul class="content">
              <li>Many of our laws originated from customary law.</li>
              <li>The authority of customary law should be limited.</li>
              <li>The customary system of law varies in different areas.</li>
           </ul>
         </div>
         <p>Here are some more examples of dependent clauses/phrases:</p>
         <div class="example">
           <ul class="content">
              <li>in resolving disputes and meting out justice</li>
              <li>outside of the major cities</li>
              <li>particularly in areas of criminal justice</li>
           </ul>
         </div>

         <p>By adding an independent clause (underlined) to each of the dependent clauses above, we can complete each sentence.</p>
         <div class="example">
          <ul class="content">
            <li><u>Village councils play the main role</u> in resolving disputes and meting out justice.</li>
            <li>Outside of the major cities, <u>village councils play the main role in resolving disputes and meting out justice.</u></li>
            <li><u>The customary system of law varies in different countries</u> particularly in areas of criminal justice.</li>
          </ul>
         </div>
         <h4>Joining two complete (independent) sentences</h4>
         <p>If you want to make a longer sentences from two complete sentences, you will need to use a linking word or phrase. For example:</p>
         <div class="example">
            <p>1. The bushfires devastated many of the areas in the Adelaide Hills.</p>
            <p>2. Many people lost their homes.</p>
            <div class="example highlight">
              <p><em>The bushfires devastated many of the areas in the Adelaide Hills <mark>and</mark> many people lost their homes.</em></p>
            </div>
          </div>
          <div class="example">
            <p>1. The national government has little control over what happens in rural areas in north-west Pakistan.</p>
            <p>2. The people rely on their village councils to enforce the law.</p>
            <div class="example highlight">
              <p><em>The national government has little control over what happens in rural areas in north-west Pakistan <mark>so</mark> the people rely on their village councils to enforce the law.</em></p>
            </div>
         </div>
      </section>
      <section id="pstructure">
         <h3>Parallel structure</h3>
         <p>Another common problem in writing is ensuring that when we list a number of components in a sentence, we must keep the same grammatical structure. Generally the rule is to use all nouns (or noun phrases) or verb + noun (or noun phrase). For example:</p>
         <div class="example highlight">
            <p>The main student attributes include an <u>ability to communicate well, think critically, and problem solving.</u></p>
          </div>
            <p>This is not a parallel structure because it uses a noun phrase, verb/noun and noun. The following sentence is correct as all nouns are used.</p>
          <div class="example indented">
            <p>The main student attributes include <u>effective communication, critical thinking, and problem solving.</u></p>
          </div>
          <p>Another example:</p>

         <div class="example highlight">
            <p>Because of <u>northerly winds blowing, out of control bush growth</u> and <u>the lack of rainfall</u> for years, the fire quickly spread.</p>
          </div>
          <p>This is not a parallel structure because it uses a noun/verb phrase, noun phrase and noun phrases. The following sentence is correct as all nouns are used.</p>
          <div class="example indented">
            <p>Because of the northerly winds, uncontrolled growth of the bush and the lack of rainfall for years, the fire quickly spread.</p>
          </div>
         </div>
      </section>
      <section id="articleuse">
        <h3>Articles</h3>
        <p>English has two types of articles: definite (the) and indefinite (a, an.) The use of these articles depends on whether the noun following the article possesses one of these paired qualities:</p>
        <h4>General or specific</h4>
        <div class="example highlight">
          <p><em>Coffee is <mark>a</mark> popular drink.</em></p>
          <p><em><mark>The</mark> most popular drink in Australia now is coffee.</em></p>
        </div>
         <h4>Countable or uncoutable</h4>
        <div class="example highlight">
           <p><em>I drank a cup of tea.</em></p>
           <p><em>I drank tea.</em></p>
          </div>
         <h4>First mentioned or subsequently mentioned</h4>
         <div class="example highlight">
            <p><mark>A</mark> cyclist crossed Trower Road on <mark>a</mark> red light and was lucky not to be hit by a car. However, the police noticed and stopped <mark>the</mark> cyclist further up <mark>the</mark> road.</p>
          </div>
         <h4>Is unique or forms part of shared knowledge</h4>
         <div class="example highlight">
            <p>Do you know I saw Tony Blair in Geneva. Do you mean <mark>the</mark> Tony Blair?</p>
         </div>
        </section>

        <section id="subjectverb">
         <h3>Subject verb agreement</h3>
         <p>Most students are familiar with the basic rules of subject verb agreement.
            For example, <u>I live</u> in Darwin, <u>she lives</u> in Melbourne and <u>the Scotts live in Bendigo</u>.
            But it becomes more complicated with the following sentence constructions:</p>
          <h4>Using a noun phrase</h4>
         <ul class="content">
            <li><u>The Commission for Renewable Energy</u> is convening the conference in Melbourne.</li>
            <li><u>The repeated scene of rioting shown on television news</u> leads some teenagers to believe that civil disorder can be a legitimate form of protest.</li>
         </ul>
         <h4>Indefinite pronoun such as someone, anyone</h4>
         <div class="example highlight">
            Anyone is going to get lost in the labyrinth of the Turkish bazaars.
         </div>
         <h4>A phrase starting with a quantifier such as some, any,</h4>
         <ul class="content">
            <li><u>Some breakfast cereals</u> have nutritious ingredients.</li>
            <li><u>Any</u> part of the crowd is at risk from the military.</li>
        <h4>Phrases using either ... or and neither ... nor</h4>
        <ul class="content">
          <li>The energy crisis will neither be solved by increasing the price of petrol nor by rationing fuel</li>
          <li>The energy crisis is not going to be solved by either increasing the price of petrol or by rationing fuel</li>
        </ul>
        <h4>Complex sentences</h4>
         <ul class="content">
            <li><u>The result</u> of atmospheric pollution and soil degradation is the destruction of plant life and increased respiratory problems amongst the population.</li>
            <li><u>Many people</u> who have been unemployed for several years and have given up hope of ever obtaining paid employment <u>are</u> beginning to think about how <u>they</u> might start <u>their</u> own small business</li>
         </ul>
        <h4>Sentences starting with words ending in 'ing'</h4>
         <ul class="content">
            <li><u>Getting into town</u> is going to be more difficult than we think after that heavy rain.</li>
            <li><u>Going without water for more than three days</u> is going to irreparably damage the vital organs of the body.</li>
         </ul>
      </section>

      <section id="punctuation">
         <h2>Punctuation</h2>
         <p>Punctuation is an essential skill that helps you to express yourself clearly, directly and effectively. They help organise your words into clauses and sentences, and hence into identifiable units of meaning.</p>
        <section id="endmarks">
          <h3>End marks</h3>
          <p>End marks are used to end a sentence. They enable you to tell your reader where one thought ends and another begins. Thus, end marks help you keep your ideas distinct so that your reader can understand what you have written.</p>
          <p>There are three ways in which a sentence can be ended:</p>
          <p><strong>Full stop</strong></p>
          <div class="example highlight">
             <ul>
                <li>This sentence finishes with a full stop.</li>
                <li>This sentence does not!</li>
             </ul>
          </div>
          <p><strong>Exclamation mark</strong></p>
          <p>An exclamation mark should be used when you intend the sentence to be either a strong command or an emphatic declaration.</p>
          <div class="example highlight">
             <ul>
                <li>Do as you are told! [strong command]</li>
                <li>Idiot! [emphatic declaration].</li>
             </ul>
          </div>
          <p><strong>Question mark</strong></p>
          <p>This is used to indicate a direct question.</p>
          <div class="example highlight">
             <p>What did you mean by that outrageous claim?</p>
          </div>
        </section id="commas">
         <h3>Commas</h3>
         <p>Being able to identify <strong>independent</strong> and <strong>dependent clauses</strong> will help you to decide where to put commas (or other punctuation) in your writing.</p>
         <p>An <strong>independent clause</strong> contains a subject and a verb.</p>
         <div class="example highlight">
            <p>The tree was losing its leaves.</p>
         </div>
         <p>So it is a complete sentence in itself. However, a <strong>dependent clause</strong> cannot stand on its own. If it is written alone, it doesn't make sense. It is an incomplete sentence. This is because it is usually missing a subject, or a verb or both.</p>
         <div class="example highlight">
            <p>Because of the drought</p>
         </div>
         <p>We join dependent and independent clauses together to ensure:</p>
         <ul class="content">
            <li>The meaning is clear: <strong>The tree was losing its leaves because of the drought.</strong></li>
            <li>The sentence is complete: <strong>Because of the drought, the tree was losing its leaves.</strong></li>
         </ul>
         <p>Commas are needed to clarify meaning when dependent and independent clauses are added to each other to form complex sentences.</p>
         <p>The general rules with commas in complex sentences are:</p>
         <ol>
            <li>If the dependent clause comes after the independent clause (highlighted), no comma is necessary.</li>
            <li><em><mark>Village councils play the main role</mark> in resolving disputes and meting out justice.</em> If the dependent clause is before the independent clause, you need a comma. <em>Outside of the major cities,<mark>village councils play the main role in resolving disputes and meting out justice.</mark></em></li>
            <li>If the dependent clause is in the middle of an independent clause or in the middle of two independent clauses, you need a comma each side of it. <em><mark>The whole parliament,</mark> aside from the President,<mark> agreed with the proposed legislation.</mark> <strong>Zahra’s family,</strong> who had lived in a small village all their lives, <mark>suddenly decided to move to the city. Tehran,</mark> with a population of more than twenty million, <mark>is a busy, chaotic city</mark></em></li>
         </ol>
         <h4>Other uses of the comma</h4>
         <p>Use a comma <strong>to separate the elements in a list.</strong></p>
         <div class="example highlight">
            <p>We need stationery, blackboards and easels for each school.</p>
         </div>
         <p>Use a comma + a conjunction (and, but, for, nor, yet, or, so) <strong>to connect two independent clauses</strong></p>
         <div class="example highlight">
            <p>The kittens were very cute, but they were really out of control.</p>
         </div>
         <p>Use a comma <strong>to separate adjectives</strong> (descriptive words)</p>
         <div class="example highlight">
            <p>That run-down, dilapidated cottage with the overgrown garden.</p>
         </div>
         <p>If you can put an <em>and</em> or a <em>but</em> between the adjectives, a comma will probably belong there.</p>
         <div class="example highlight">
            <p>For instance, you could say, "I live in a very old and run-down house."</p>
         </div>
         <p>Use a comma <strong>to set off quoted elements</strong>. Because we don't use quoted material all the time, even when writing, this is probably the most difficult rule to remember in comma usage.</p>
         <div class="example highlight">
            <p>Williams (2003) said, “It is highly unlikely that school improvement projects really work as they are intended.”</p>
         </div>
         <p>Use commas to set off phrases that express contrast.</p>
         <div class="example highlight">
            <p>Some say the world will end in ice, not fire.</p>
         </div>
         <p>Use a comma to <strong>avoid confusion</strong> or misunderstanding.</p>
         <div class="example">
         <ul class="content">
           <li>For most, the year is already finished.</li>
           <li>Woman without her man would be useless.</li>
           <li>Woman, without her, man would be useless</li>
         </ul>
         </div>
         <p>Typographical Reasons:</p>
         <div class="example highlight">
            <p>Use a comma between a town and a state [Bendigo, Victoria], a date and the year [June 15, 1997],</p>
         </div>
       </section>
         <section id="colons">
           <h3>Colons</h3>
           <p>Colons (written as : ) are used mainly to introduce lists, summaries, or quotations. For example:</p>
           <p>A list:</p>

              <p>The company's financial position can be summarised in one word: disastrous.</p>
           </div>
           <p>A quote:</p>
           <div class="example highlight">
              <p>Within western philosophy, for a man the question of the sex of his body does not arise: A man never begins by presenting himself as an individual of a certain sex; it goes without saying that he is a man (de Beauvoir 1988, 15).</p>

        <section id="semicolons">
          <h3>Semicolons</h3>
          <p>Semicolons (written as ;) are used to link two closely related Independent sentences. For example:</p>
          <div class="example highlight">
             <p>The chef prepared the fancy dishes; the assistants did the rest.</p>
             <p>The students entered through the main doors; the lecturers had their own entrance.</p>
          </div>
          <p>You can also use a semicolon to separate comma-containing phrases within a list. For example:</p>
          <div class="example highlight">
             <ul>
                <li>We shall need three tents; six rucksacks containing tools, first aid kits, and insect repellents; six utilities pouches for maps, small hand tools, spare batteries and compasses; and six two-way radios.</li>
             </ul>
          </div>
        </section>
        <section id="apostrophe">
          <h3>Apostrophes</h3>
          <p>An apostrophe is used to indicate that a subject possesses or owns an object. For example:</p>
          <div class="example highlight">
             <p>George's car. (i.e. the car belonging to or of George)</p>
             <p>The council's car park. (i.e. the car park of the council).</p>
          </div>
          <p>Note that the possessive form of It is Its (without the apostrophe). It’s means It is... For example:</p>
          <div class="example highlight">
             <p>The snake shed its skin (i.e. the skin belongs to 'it')</p>
             <p>It's the snake's skin (i.e. It is the skin of the snake).</p>
          </div>
          <p>For plural nouns ending with an 's', it is usually not necessary to add an 's'. For example:</p>
          <div class="example highlight">
             <p>cows' milk (i.e. the milk of the cows)</p>
             <p>lawyers' fees (i.e. the fees of lawyers).</p>
          </div>
          <p>Apostrophes are also used in contractions.  For example:</p>
          <div class="example highlight">
             <p>don't (do not)</p>
             <p>hasn't (has not)</p>
          </div>
        </section>
    <section id="quotmarks">
      <h3>Quotation marks</h3>
      <p>Quotation marks can either be single (i.e. '...') or double ("...") and are used to indicate direct speech or material that has been written by someone else.</p>
      <p>Direct speech:</p>
      <div class="example highlight">
         <p>She said, "Get the cat out of the house."</p>
      </div>
      <p>Quoting someone else's writing:</p>
      <div class="example highlight">
         <p>Far too many people fail to understand the sexism of Aristotle's claim that "man was a political animal".</p>
      </div>
      <p>Quotation marks can also be used to highlight a word that is being defined or named. For example:</p>
    </section>
         <section id="parentheses">
           <h3>Parentheses</h3>
           <p>Parentheses are brackets that you can use to indicate explanatory or interrupting material (sometimes referred to as parenthetical material), which is not essential for the meaning of a sentence.</p>
           <p>For example:</p>
           <div class="example highlight">
              <p>Seven different colours (red, orange, yellow, green, blue, indigo and violet) combine to form white light.</p>
           </div>
           <p>Brackets can be round '( )', or square '[ ]' or squiggly '{ }'.</p>
           <p>Brackets are also used to set off numbers, especially in lists. For example:</p>
           <div class="example highlight">
              <ul>
                 <li>See Section 1 (a)</li>
                 <li>An essay usually consists of three main parts: (1) an introduction, (2) a body, and (3) a conclusion.</li>
              </ul>
           </div>
         </section>
         <section id="dashes">
           <h3>Dashes</h3>
           <p>Dashes can be used in a similar fashion to brackets to make a parenthetical comment. For example:</p>
           <div class="example highlight">
              <p>Three gangsters - Scarface, Itchy, and Knuckles - left before the dust had cleared.</p>
           </div>
           <p>Dashes are generally considered a weaker form of parenthetical marker than brackets.</p>
         </section>
         <section id="hyphens">
           <h3>Hyphens</h3>
           <p>Hyphens are used to form compound words such as 'semi-colon' or 'half-back'. Hyphens are also used to help clarify the meaning of compound words.</p>
         </section>
         <section id="ellipsis">
           <h3>Ellipsis</h3>
           <p>An ellipsis indicates that words have been left out of the material that you have quoted.</p>
           <p>It is sometimes necessary to leave out words or lines in a quoted passage for reasons of relevance (to your point) or length.
            It is important that any omissions are made known to your reader. The modern way of doing this is by using three full stops (known as an ellipsis).</p>
           <div class="example highlight">
              <p>The conclusion is used to sum up the points that have been covered in the essay… This section should not contain any new information and should refer back to the topic/question being discussed (Cheek et al. 1995, p. 102).</p>
           </div>
           <p>In this passage, an extra sentence of twenty-seven words has been left out. The three dots occur at the end of the sentence. There is no need to add a full stop. The following example demonstrates an ellipsis indicating missing words.</p>
           <div class="example highlight">
              <p>This section … should refer back to the topic/question being discussed.</p>
           </div>
           <p>The most important consideration when using an ellipsis is to ensure that you do not alter the intended meaning of the original material.</p>
