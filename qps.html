            <h1>Quoting, Paraphrasing and Summarising</h1>
            <p>Any writing you do at university will require reference to recognised experts or authorities in that particular subject area (discipline), to give the thoughts, ideas and information in your assignment credibility.</p>
            <p>There are three ways of including the ideas of an expert in your text: quoting, paraphrasing, summarising. No matter what you choose to do, you must <a href="http://learnline.cdu.edu.au/studyskills/studyskills/introreferencing.html">acknowledge the source</a> of these ideas.</p>

               Short quotes, quotes of less than three lines, should be written into the paragraph and shown by quotation marks: “.............”.

               <p>Gandhi's philosophy of non-violence was essentially a philosophy of action, a means of resolving conflict and creating a just society free of violence. <mark>"By non-violence Gandhi means … the technique of conducting social relations characterised by constructive peaceful attitudes …" </mark>(Bondurant 1988, p.193). For Gandhi, this meant living a life of 'truth'.</p>

            <p>Long quotes, quotes of more than three lines or 40 words, should be indented and separated from the paragraph. No quotation marks are needed.</p>

               <p>If writing, even occasionally, causes you grief and misery, you are in very respectable company. Publius Vergilius Maro, otherwise known as Virgil, started  his epic poem, the Aeneid, in 29 B.C. and continued writing it until 19 B.C. That is an average of a line a day for eleven years, and even then it was not finished. (Klauser 1987, p.7).</p>

            <p>[ ] Square brackets in a quote show that the writer has added words to the original quote. This may be necessary to clarify what is being said.</p>

            <p>An ellipsis … mark shows that part of the quote has been omitted. This is useful if you don't want to include all of a statement.</p>

            <h2>Paraphrasing</h2>
            <p>Paraphrasing means using your own words to report someone else's material or ideas. You will need to paraphrase when you want to change the style or the language used in the original either to make it easier to understand or to make it fit better into your own piece of writing. Unlike a summary, a paraphrase is usually about the same length as the original, but both the words and the sentence structure must be changed in a paraphrase. An idea that has been paraphrased must also acknowledge the source of that idea.</p>
            <p>The most effective way to paraphrase is to use the following method:</p>
            <ol>
               <li>Read the sentence/s several times carefully to make sure you understand the meaning.</li>
               <li>Highlight the key words and phrases.</li>
               <li>Cover up the original and try writing down the substance of the sentence/s from memory in your own words.</li>
               <li>Now check the original. Make sure you did not leave out anything important or added something that isn't there.</li>
               <li>Check your wording. Make sure you have not used the same words as the original. If you have, change them.</li>
               <li>If there is an expression that you do not want to change, put quotation marks around it and paraphrase the rest. </li>

               <p><em>(Original taken from Wajnryb, R 1990, Grammar Dictation, Oxford University Press, Oxford)</em></p>
               <p><mark>Teen suicide</mark> is an increasing source of <mark>concern in today's society</mark>. Health professionals attribute it to a <mark>reaction</mark> to <mark>unresolved conflict</mark> within the family and to <mark>stress</mark>, both, real or perceived. Over the last twenty years the <mark>incidence of suicide among teenage boys</mark> has <mark>doubled</mark>, while that for girls has fallen. This trend is <mark>explained in two ways</mark>, one quite immediate and objective, the other more interpretive. Firstly, there is the fact that <mark>boys usually choose more violent ways of killing themselves.</mark> Secondly, among <mark>broken families</mark>, where the children usually stay with the mother rather than the father, the <mark>loss of a father</mark> makes a <mark>greater impact on a boy</mark> that a girl, leading to a <mark>greater probability of psychological injury</mark>.

            <div id="paraphrase1" class="tabcontent">
               <p>Wajnryb (1990) argues that an increasing incidence in suicide amongst young males is a worrying trend in our society. Generally, it is acknowledged that suicide is a result of stress or conflict. However, the significant increase in suicide amongst boys in the past twenty years needs to be further explained. Wajnryb suggests that there are two main reasons for this. The first is to do with the fact that boys generally chose a violent means of killing themselves. The second is to do with family breakdown. That is, it is believed that family breakdown, which often results in the loss of a father in the family home, affects boys in far more significant ways and is more likely to lead to psychological harm.</p>

            <h2>Summarising</h2>
            <p>A summary, as compared to a paraphrase, is always much shorter that the original text. When you write a summary, you limit yourself to giving your readers only the main idea/argument of an article or chapter of a book. To write a good summary, keep the following points in mind:</p>
            <ol>
               <li>Read the original carefully ensuring that you understand the extract.</li>
               <li>Mention the author (and date) at the beginning of the summary and add again if you need to remind the reader that you are summarising another person’s ideas.</li>
               <li>State the author's main idea without distorting those ideas or adding your own.</li>
               <li>State the author's most important supporting evidence or sub-points without distorting them. Do not include details.</li>
               <li>Use your own wording. If there is a phrase in the original text that is especially striking, interesting, or controversial, or really cannot be changed without distorting its meaning, use the author's exact words and put quotation marks around them.</li>
               <li>Don't include your own ideas or comments (editorial remarks). The summary should include only the author's ideas.</li>
            </ol>

               <p><strong>“Migrants don't cost jobs” </strong>
               <p>by Peter Boyle (The Bulletin December,1998)</p>
               <p>If recent polls are to be believed, a majority of Australians are in favour of stopping immigration at least in the short term. According to a November 2-3 AGB-McNair Poll, 62% are in favour of a "short term freeze", and a Bulletin Morgan Poll of October 22-23 found 66% in favour of "stopping immigration in the short term". While neither poll sought out the reasons for this anti-immigration sentiment, studies of earlier polls suggest that the main reason is a fear that immigration might be causing, or at least exacerbating, unemployment.</p>
