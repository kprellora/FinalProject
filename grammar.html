        <h1>Grammar</h1>
        <p>n writing in an academic style, or any style, it is important to know about sentence and word structure.</p>

        <h2>Problems in sentence construction</h2>
        <p>this section, common problems relating toconstructing sentences have been identified so that students can become aware of these and avoid them in their writing.</p>
      </section>

      <section id="sstructure">
        <h3>Sentence Structure</h3>
        <p>tences can be short and concise, or longer and more complex. However, it is important to vary the length of your sentences so that your writing doesn't sound too abrupt (with the overuse of short sentences), or too densely packed with ideas (with the overuse of long sentences).</p>
        <p> of the most common problems in writing is students writing sentence fragments rather than complete sentences.</p>

        <h4>What is a sentence?</h4>
        <p>omplete sentence (which is also called an independent clause) must always contain a subject and a verb. For example:</p>
        <div class="example">
          <p><em>The bushfires devastated many of the areas in the Adelaide Hills</em></p>
        </div>
        <p>s first sentence contains a subject (The bushfires) and a verb (devastated) and then more information in given about what the bushfires devastated.</p>
        <p> may sometimes see sentences without a subject but these are usually instructions. For example</p>
        <div class="example">
          <p><em>Use the exit stairs in case of fire.</em></p>
        </div>
        <p> subject (you or anybody reading this notice) is inferred from the situation but the verb is still there.</p>

        <h4>What is a sentence fragment?</h4>
        <p>entence fragment (which may also be a dependent clause) is an incomplete sentence because it is missing either the subject or the verb or both. For example:</p>
        <div class="example">
          <p><em>Because of the northerly winds</em></p>
        </div>
        <p>a longer version:</p>
        <div class="example">
          <p><em>Because of the northerly winds, years of drought and tinder-box bushland, along with an ill-prepared and under-equipped country fire service</em></p>
        </div>
        <p> sentence fragment can be made into a complete sentence:</p>
        <div class="example">
          <p><em>Because of the northerly winds, <strong>the fire spread quickly through the bushland.</strong></em></p>
        </div>
        <div class="example">
        <p>The fire spread quickly through the bushland because of the northerly winds, years of drought and tinder-box bushland, along with an ill-prepared and under-equipped country fire service.</p>
        </div>
        <p>e are some more examples of independent clauses:</p>
        <ol type="a">
          <li>Many of our laws originated from customary law.</li>
          <li>The authority of customary law should be limited.</li>
          <li>The customary system of law varies in different areas.</li>
        </ol>
        <p>e are some more examples of dependent clauses/phrases:</p>
        <ol type="a">
          <li>in resolving disputes and meting out justice</li>
          <li>outside of the major cities</li>
          <li>particularly in areas of criminal justice</li>
        </ol>
        <p>adding an independent clause (underlined) to each of the dependent clauses above, we can complete each sentence.</p>
        <div class="example">
          <p><u>Village councils play the main role</u> in resolving disputes and meting out justice.</p>
          <p>Outside of the major cities, <u>village councils play the main role in resolving disputes and meting out justice.</u></p>
          <p><u>The customary system of law varies in different countries</u> particularly in areas of criminal justice.</p>
        </div>

        <h4>Joining two complete (independent) sentences</h4>
        <p>you want to make a longer sentences from two complete sentences, you will need to use a linking word or phrase. For example:</p>
        <div class="example">
          <p><em>The bushfires devastated many of the areas in the Adelaide Hills. Many people lost their homes.</em></p>
          <p><em>The bushfires devastated many of the areas in the Adelaide Hills <strong>and</strong> many people lost their homes.</em></p>
          <p><em>The national government has little control over what happens in rural areas in north-west Pakistan. The people rely on their village councils to enforce the law</em></p>
          <p><em>The national government has little control over what happens in rural areas in north-west Pakistan <strong>so</strong> the people rely on their village councils to enforce the law.</em></p>
        </div>
      </section>

      <section id="pstructure">
        <h3>Parallel structure</h3>
        <p>ther common problem in writing is ensuring that when we list a number of components in a sentence, we must keep the same grammatical structure. Generally the rule is to use all nouns (or noun phrases) or verb + noun (or noun phrase). For example:</p>
        <div class="example">
          <p>The main student attributes include an <u>ability to communicate well, think critically, and problem solving.</u></p>
          <p>This is not a parallel structure because it uses a noun phrase, verb/noun and noun. The following sentence is correct as all nouns are used.</p>
          <p>The main student attributes include <u>effective communication, critical thinking, and problem solving.</u></p>
        </div>
        <div class="example">
          <p>Because of <u>northerly winds blowing, out of control bush growth</u> and <u>the lack of rainfall</u> for years, the fire quickly spread.</p>
        </div>
      </section>

      <section id="articleuse">
        <h3>Articles</h3>
        <h4>Definition of articles</h4>
        <p>English has two types of articles: definite (the) and indefinite (a, an.) The use of these articles depends on whether the noun following the article possesses one of these paired qualities:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>General or specific</li>
        </ul>
        <div class="example">
          <p>Coffee is <strong>a</strong> popular drink.</em></p>
          <p><em><strong>The</strong> most popular drink in Australia now is coffee.</em></p>
        </div>
        <ul>
         <li>Countable or uncoutable</li>
        </ul>
        <p>I drank a cup of tea.</em></p>
        <p>I drank tea.</em></p>
        <ul>
          <li>First mentioned or subsequently mentioned</li>
        </ul>
        <div class="example">
          <p><strong>A</strong> cyclist crossed Trower Road on <strong>a</strong> red light and was lucky not to be hit by a car. However, the police noticed and stopped <strong>the</strong> cyclist further up <strong>the</strong> road.</p>
        </div>
        <ul>
          <li>Is unique or forms part of shared knowledge</li>
        </ul>
        <div class="example">
          <p>Do you know I saw Tony Blair in Geneva. Do you mean <strong>the</strong> Tony Blair?</p>
        </div>
      </section>

      <section id="subjectverb">
        <h3>Subject-verb agreement</h3>
        <p>t students are familiar with the basic rules of subject verb agreement.
        For example, <u>I live</u> in Darwin, <u>she lives</u> in Melbourne and <u>the Scotts live in Bendigo</u>.
        But it becomes more complicated with the following sentence constructions:</p>
        <div class="example">
          <p><u>The Commission for Renewable Energy</u> is convening the conference in Melbourne.</p>
          <p><u>The repeated scene of rioting shown on television news</u> leads some teenagers to believe that civil disorder can be a legitimate form of protest.</p>
        </div>
        <ul>
          <li>Indefinite pronoun such as someone, anyone</li>
        </ul>
        <div class="example">
          <p>Anyone is going to get lost in the labyrinth of the Turkish bazaars.</p>
        </div>
        <ul>
          <li>A phrase starting with a quantifier such as some, any,</li>
        </ul>
        <div class="example">
          <p><u>Some breakfast cereals</u> have nutritious ingredients.</p>
          <p>Any part of the crowd is at risk from the military.</p>
        </div>
        <ul>
          <li>Phrases using either ... or and neither ... nor</li>
        </ul>
        <div class="example">
          <p>The energy crisis will neither be solved by increasing the price of petrol nor by rationing fuel.</p>
          <p>The energy crisis is not going to be solved by either increasing the price of petrol or by rationing fuel.</p>
        </div>
        <ul>
          <li>Complex sentences</li>
        </ul>
        <div class="example">
          <p><u>The result</u> of atmospheric pollution and soil degradation is the destruction of plant life and increased respiratory problems amongst the population.</p>
          <p><u>Many people</u> who have been unemployed for several years and have given up hope of ever obtaining paid employment <u>are</u> beginning to think about how <u>they</u> might start <u>their</u> own small business</p>
        </div>
        <ul>
          <li>Sentences starting with words ending in 'ing'</li>
        </ul>
        <div class="example">
          <p><u>Getting into town</u> is going to be more difficult than we think after that heavy rain.</p>
          <p><u>Going without water for more than three days</u> is going to irreparably damage the vital organs of the body.</p>
